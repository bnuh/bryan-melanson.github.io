This album was created in 24 hours as part of the *24 Hour Art Marathon* fundraiser for the Eastern Edge Art Gallery. A video for "To o Can Gica" was produced in that period and performed live, 20 copies were burned and packaging was stenciled. Lots of recordings of people wandering through the area, harborside St. John's at 4 AM in the morning, and guitar by Mike Wyatt.

The digital version includes covers of songs by K-Ci and Jojo, the Weakerthans and Eric's Trip.
