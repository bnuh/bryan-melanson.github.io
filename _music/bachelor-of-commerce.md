Half of this album was written as a joke as I tried out the novelty that was music production software and learned how to make music. Sending songs to friends to try to make them laugh evolved into posting MP3s as I finished them on MySpace or some early public music hosting site for strangers to hear. As people became interested, Polygon Records put people onto the music through their network, and it blew up on some German techno blog. It got the interest of some electronic music record label, and they warned me their lawyer told them Supertramp would likely sue me for some samples on the album. I should have pushed for it, because I think the idea of being financially crushed by Supertramp is funny.

Elling Lien of Polygon redesigned the terrible album art and hosted the album, because I never got a website and refused to promote anything.
