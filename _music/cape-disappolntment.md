This album was written as part of the 2009 [RPM Challenge](https://www.rpmchallenge.com/), which tasks participants with producing an album in the month of February. Album art and videos for "Adopting a River" and "Meet Me in Your Mom's Closet" were shot by Brian Williams.

The digital version includes songs that were played live but never made it into a release, including "Are We Downhearted?" "Warmer Climates" and "Ghost Ships of the Great Lakes".
