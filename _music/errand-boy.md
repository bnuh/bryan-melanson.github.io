There was a record label in New Brunswick that wanted to sign me for a while after I put out [Bachelor of Commerce](bachelor-of-commerce.md), but once I started sending them songs from this album as I completed them they didn't seem thrilled and didn't see an audience for this sort of thing. They were probably right, but I didn't listen.

Around this time people started asking me to play music live, so I started to produce music videos to project behind me and Mike Wyatt as we played live.
