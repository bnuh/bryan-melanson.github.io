My friends in the band Veneers requisitioned these three instrumentals interludes for their album "Similar Stories". The album is built from only a handful of samples - the intro to "Long December" by Counting Crows, a guitar sample from the Veneers album played and recorded back and forth between a tape recorder and my digital interface, fireworks and crowd noise from a New Year's party I really didn't want to be at, and drones from an electric organ I bought from an antiques shop in Montreal.
